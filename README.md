# 5-Day AI Agents Intensive Course with Google

## Overview

Build and deploy the next frontier of AI with this no-cost intensive course. Following the success of last year's Generative AI course (420,000+ learners), this sequel focuses on AI agents - from simple implementations to sophisticated multi-agent systems.

**Dates:** November 10â€“14, 2025  
**Format:** Online, self-paced with live components  
**Level:** All levels welcome

## What You'll Learn

Master the core components of AI agents:
- Models and architectures
- Tools and orchestration
- Memory management
- Evaluation and metrics
- Production deployment

Move beyond LLM prototypes to production-ready autonomous systems through hands-on practice and a capstone project.
